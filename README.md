# 🍩 Dunkin Clone – Modern Coffee Shop Website (React + Supabase)

## 📖 Project Overview  
**Dunkin Clone** is a fully responsive web application inspired by *Dunkin Donuts*, but completely redesigned and developed from scratch using **React.js** and **Bootstrap**.  
It’s built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** that uses **Axios** to fetch data from **Supabase**, which serves as the backend and database.  

The goal of this project is to provide a professional, modern, and dynamic coffee shop experience that can easily be extended into a real-world e-commerce application.
